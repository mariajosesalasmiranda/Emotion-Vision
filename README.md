# Emotion Recognition with Python
## Overview 
This project focuses on real-time emotion recognition using Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV. The goal is to detect emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, confusion, and fear from live video feed through a webcam. üìπ

## Features
- Trained a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to recognize emotions.
- Implemented live video analysis using OpenCV and a webcam.
- Supports detection of the following emotions: happy, sad, angry, confused, and scared.

## Contents
- **train_model.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code to train and evaluate the emotion recognition model.
- **emotion_recognition.py**: Python script to perform live emotion recognition on video using OpenCV and the trained model.
- **Facial Data/**:
  - **happy/**: Folder containing images of people displaying happiness.
  - **sad/**: Folder containing images of people displaying sadness.
  - **angry/**: Folder containing images of people displaying anger.
  - **confused/**: Folder containing images of people displaying confusion.
  - **scared/**: Folder containing images of people displaying fear.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies needed to run the project.
- **haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml**: XML file used for face detection with OpenCV's cascade classifiers.
- **LICENSE**: License file.

## Usage
- Training the Model:
Open and run the **train_model.ipynb** notebook to train and evaluate the model. Ensure you have **TensorFlow** and **Keras** installed.

- Live Emotion Recognition:
Run **emotion_recognition.py** to start the live emotion recognition from your webcam.
